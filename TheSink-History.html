			<h1>History</h1>
				<h2>Why did we change the name?</h2>
<p> CW: mentions of sexual violence and suicide
The Sink Coffee show changed its name from The Rez Cafe in 2020 out of respect for Native American peoples. "The Rez" is slang for a Native American reservation - an area of land legally designated by the US government to be managed by a federally recognized Native American tribe. 
There are over 570**** federally recognized tribes and 362 reservations. Native American reservations have been used by the US government throughout history to violently displace, relocate and imprison Native American people. Today, Native American reservations suffer from higher poverty rates, lower education levels, higher sexual violence rates and higher suicide rates. </p>

				<h2>Land Acknowledgment</h2> 
				<p>The Sink Coffe Shop is located on the lands of the Wampanoag, Pawtucket and the Masschuset tribal nations. In 1879, during excavations on the Tufts Residentential quad, a Native American burial mound was unearthed. We recognize that Tufts was built without permission on these sites and disregards these relationships of care and protection. This statement acknowledges that the surrounding lands and waters are part of the ancestral snd unceded territory of the Masschuset, Pawtucket and Wampanoag Peoples. We also wish to recongize that we are in the area of what was once a slave-holding estate called Ten Hills Plantation and that Tufts benefitted from the economies of salvery.</p>
