				<h2>Land Acknowledgment</h2>
				<p>The Sink Coffee Shop is located on the lands of the Wampanoag, Pawtucket and the Masschuset tribal nations. In 1879, during excavations on the Tufts Residentential quad, a Native American burial mound was unearthed. We recognize that Tufts was built without permission on these sites and disregards these relationships of care and protection. This statement acknowledges that the surrounding lands and waters are part of the ancestral snd unceded territory of the Masschuset, Pawtucket and Wampanoag Peoples. We also wish to recongize that we are in the area of what was once a slave-holding estate called Ten Hills Plantation and that Tufts benefitted from the economies of salvery.</p>

				<h2>Why did we Change the Name?</h2>
				<h3>Cw: mentions of sexual violence and suicide</h3>
				<p>The Sink Coffee Shop changed its name from The Rez Cafe in 2020 out of repect for Native American peoples. "The Rez" is slang for a Native American reservation - an area of land legally designated by the US government to be managed by a federally recognized Native American tribe. There are over 570 federally recognized tribes and 362 reservations. Native American reservations have been used by the US government throughout history to violently displace, relocate and imprison Native American people. Today, Native American reservations suffer from higer poverty rates, lower education levels, higher sexual violence rates and higher suicide rates.</p>

				<h2>The name "The Rez" evokes these histories and lived experiences, and failure to recognize these impacts would be a reinscription of violence towards Native American people and culture</h2>
				<p>We apologize ffor the damages and discomforts our name has caused. While some believe The Rez Cafe was named after the reservoir that used to be on the res quad, it does not erase the impact the name has on people, especially in the context of this history. Names and language are constantly changing and we are fortunate enough to be able to change the name now, thanks to the effort and voices of Native people at Tufts</p>

				<h2>This is only the first step in a long term commitment to critically thinking about how we can better support indigenous communities and uphold Native American histories in meaningful ways.</h2>
				<p>We are dedicated to both self-educating within The Sink staff as well as creating a viable way to share a portion of our profits to Wet'suwet'en Land Defenders. We are activley looking for ways to expand this effort and welcome suggestions in this regard as well!</p>
