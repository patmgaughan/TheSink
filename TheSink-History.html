				<h2>Land Acknowledgment</h2>
				<p>The Sink Coffe Shop is located on the lands of the Wampanoag, Pawtucket and the Masschuset tribal nations. In 1879, during excavations on the Tufts Residentential quad, a Native American burial mound was unearthed. We recognize that Tufts was built without permission on these sites and disregards these relationships of care and protection. This statement acknowledges that the surrounding lands and waters are part of the ancestral snd unceded territory of the Masschuset, Pawtucket and Wampanoag Peoples. We also wish to recongize that we are in the area of what was once a slave-holding estate called Ten Hills Plantation and that Tufts benefitted from the economies of salvery.</p>
